"""Per-layer, per-kind adaptive bit budget allocation for KVTC.

Instead of uniform bits across all layers, allocate more bits to
high-entropy layers and fewer to low-entropy ones. The total bit
budget is preserved — bits are redistributed, not added.

Key insight: different layers have wildly different compressibility.
Layer 27 keys might compress at 0.5 bits while layer 25 values need 5 bits.
Giving them the same budget wastes bits on easy layers and starves hard ones.
